# Docker Image

Docker Hub: [bestbuy-staff-service](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/praj0080/bestbuy-staff-service/general)

## Deployment on AKS
LoadBalancer on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is implemented to expose the application, which is deployed using Kubernetes.

Kubernative file: aks-deployment.yaml

To apply manually
```
kubectl apply -f aks-deployment.yaml
```
## CI/CD Pipeline
A GitHub Actions process is incorporated into the work in order to automate the build, test, and deployment phases.

.github/workflows/ci_cd.yaml is the workflow file.

This process:

creates the Docker image

sends it to Docker Hub.

deploys into AKS (if secrets are set up).

#  Technical Issues Encountered

-Authentication problems caused Docker push unsuccessfully at first; this was fixed by relogging into the Docker CLI.
-It took a few minutes to determine the LoadBalancer IP on AKS (usually for Azure).
-Throughout the CI/CD secret setup process, Azure CLI required to be re-authenticated.
